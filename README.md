ðŸŽ¯ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

I managed a successful deploy and attempted two of the stretch goals. I was pretty happy with researching (using the workshop and stackoverflow) and implementing the metadatafunction when I got around to it but it did take me a lot of time playing around after implementing OAuth as I needed to log in to get the URL to use in the metadata and it was giving me a 404 everytime I went to log in.

It was the error handling that had me bogged down. I implemented it in the metadata but when it came to the voting there was already an error for users not being logged in. I couldn't test this in my environments because I couldn't access posts to even attempt to vote without being logged in and this is where I got caught in a loop.
